# PortFlix-A Personal Portfoilo Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project aims to create an online platform to showcase my skills, experience, and personality. The website will serve as a professional representation of myself, making it easier for potential employers and collaborators to find and connect with me.

Flow of Project:
Below is the flow of the project, highlighting the key sections of the website:

Homepage:

The homepage will act as an introduction, providing visitors with an overview of my portfolio and what I have to offer.
It will be designed to make a strong first impression and encourage visitors to explore further.
About Me:

This dedicated "About Me" page will provide more detailed information about myself.
It will include my background, experiences, skills, interests, and anything that sets me apart.
The aim is to give visitors a glimpse into who I am as a professional and as a person.
Portfolio:

The portfolio section will showcase my work, projects, and achievements.
It will be organized in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner to highlight the diversity of my skills and accomplishments.
Each project will have a brief description and possibly images or media to provide a better understanding of the work.
Resume/CV:

In this section, I will provide a downloadable or accessible version of my resume/CV.
The resume/CV will be presented in a professional format, ensuring it is easy to read and contains all relevant information.
Contact:

The contact page will enable visitors to get in touch with me easily.
It may include a contact form or direct contact information like email or phone number.
The goal is to facilitate communication between potential employers or collaborators and myself.
